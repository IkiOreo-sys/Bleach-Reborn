# Bleach-Reborn
Hello, I am new to modding, I am also not the best at java, still somewhat new. I picked up Bleach Reborn development from a friend who no longer has time, I am still learning and haven't added a whole lot to the mod. So I decided to open source the mods so people can read source code and pick out the bugs I can't and also make contributions!
